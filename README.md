# Contacts Example

## Running The App

To run the app, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed. This provides the platform on which the build tooling runs.
2. From the project folder, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```
3. Ensure that [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g gulp
  ```
  > **Note:** Gulp must be installed globally, but a local version will also be installed to ensure a compatible version is used for the project.
4. Ensure that [jspm](http://jspm.io/) is installed globally. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g jspm
  ```

  ```shell
  jspm install -y
  ```

6. To run the app, execute the following command:

  ```shell
  gulp watch
  ```
7. Browse to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to see the app. You can make changes in the code found under `src` and the browser should auto-refresh itself as you save files.



## Running The Unit Tests


1. Ensure that the [Karma](http://karma-runner.github.io/) CLI is installed. If you need to install it, use the following command:

  ```shell
  npm install -g karma-cli
  ```
2. Install Aurelia libs for test visibility:

  ```shell
  jspm install aurelia-framework
  jspm install aurelia-http-client
  jspm install aurelia-router
  ```
3. You can now run the tests with this command:

  ```shell
  karma start
  ```

## Running The E2E Tests
Integration tests are performed with [Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/).

1. Place your E2E-Tests into the folder ```test/e2e/src```
2. Install the necessary webdriver

  ```shell
  gulp webdriver-update
  ```

3. Configure the path to the webdriver by opening the file ```protractor.conf.js``` and adjusting the ```seleniumServerJar``` property. Typically its only needed to adjust the version number.

4. Make sure your app runs and is accessible

  ```shell
  gulp watch
  ```

5. In another console run the E2E-Tests

  ```shell
  gulp e2e
  ```
